## Development Guidelines & Best Practices

### Code Organization

- **Components:** Organized by feature in `src/app/_components/`
- **API Logic:** Server Actions in `src/api/` with `'use server'` directive
- **Types:** Supabase-generated types in `src/types/definitions.ts`, custom types in feature-specific files
- **Utils:** General utilities in `src/utils/`, helpers in `src/helpers/`
- **Constants:** Project-wide constants in `src/constants.tsx`

### Styling Conventions

- **Primary Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes
- **Component Composition:** Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- **Icons:** Exclusively use `lucide-react` for consistency
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Theme Support:** CSS variables for light/dark mode compatibility

### Data Flow Patterns

- **Server Components:** For initial data fetching and SEO
- **Client Components:** For interactive features (marked with `'use client'`)
- **Server Actions:** For all database mutations and server-side logic
- **Context Providers:** For global state (user session, auth modals)
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript with proper type definitions

### Quality Assurance

- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier with pre-commit hooks using Husky and lint-staged
- **Type Checking:** Strict TypeScript configuration with `tsc --noEmit` checks
- **Testing Strategy:** (To be implemented)
- **Performance:** Next.js optimizations, image optimization, Server Components for SSR
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Bundle Analysis:** Next.js built-in bundle analyzer capabilities
- **Linting:** Custom ESLint configuration with Next.js and TypeScript rules

### Development Workflow Guidelines

- **Development Server:** Developers typically run `npm run dev` once and keep it running throughout the development session
- **Hot Reloading:** Next.js automatically detects changes and reloads the browser - no need to restart the dev server
- **AI Development Assistance:** When making code changes during development sessions, **DO NOT** run `npm run dev` again as it's likely already running
- **Testing Changes:** Changes can be verified by checking the browser since hot reloading handles updates automatically
- **When to Restart:** Only restart the dev server if there are configuration changes (e.g., environment variables, next.config.js changes) or if there are server errors

### Deployment & Operations

- **Database:** Supabase hosted PostgreSQL
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage with organized bucket structure
- **Environment Management:** Separate configurations for development and production
- **Monitoring:** (To be implemented)

## Next Steps

1. **Review and prioritize current task list in `_TASKS.md`**
2. **Complete nutritional information system implementation**
3. **Enhance user experience with search and rating features**
4. **Implement comprehensive testing strategy**
5. **Plan Phase 2 social features based on user feedback**

This plan serves as both a technical reference and strategic roadmap for continued development of the Recipe App platform.
